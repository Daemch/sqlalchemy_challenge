VACATION EXPLORATION

Congratulations to me on deciding to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
To help with the trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

In the file:
CLIMATE ANALYSIS
The climate analysis calculates the percipitaion measurements in Honolulu over a year's period. 
The data shows that the lowest percipitation is from December to February. Although I don't mind a
little rain, the highest parcipitation measurements are during their stormy season July to October.
